   <h1>Relaxation Mode</h1>
   <p><strong>Things that relax me that will probably kill me in the end</strong></p>
  <p>At this point, you're probably wondering how you got here. To be honest, I don't know how you got here either but since you are here, let's chill. Now we all have busy schedules, it's inevitable that we would as humans, however we all need something to take the stress off of our backs now and then. For me, I love being alone and away from society, it allows me to recharge my social battery after a long week (even though many of my friends do not truly understand this). I also have little activites and environmental settings that aid in my recovery from human interactions. Below, I have complied a list of things that help me not strangle the human race even when I'm highly annoyed:</p>
  <ol>
    <strong><li>Coffee</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Music</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Ambient Lighting</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Sports</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Youtube</li></strong>
   <strong><li>My bed</li></strong>
  </ol>
  <p>Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let's dive into my world of relaxation and why it is a necessity to keep me sane.</p>
