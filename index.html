   <h1>Relaxation Mode</h1>
   <p><strong>Things that relax me that will probably kill me in the end</strong></p>
  <p>At this point, you're probably wondering how you got here. To be honest, I don't know how you got here either but since you are here, let's chill. Now we all have busy schedules, it's inevitable that we would as humans, however we all need something to take the stress off of our backs now and then. For me, I love being alone and away from society, it allows me to recharge my social battery after a long week (even though many of my friends do not truly understand this). I also have little activites and environmental settings that aid in my recovery from human interactions. Below, I have complied a list of things that help me not strangle the human race even when I'm highly annoyed:</p>
  <ol>
    <strong><li>Coffee</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Music</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Ambient Lighting</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Sports</li></strong>
   <strong><li>Youtube</li></strong>
   <strong><li>My bed</li></strong>
  </ol>
  <p>Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let's dive into my world of relaxation and why it is a necessity to keep me sane.</p>
  <h2>My Relaxation Must-Haves</h2>
  <p>Before we begin, I would like to introduce some of my stress triggers. These triggers are low key (high key) things that annoy me, but I try to cover up because I don't need to become the internet's next viral sensation. These triggers include, but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"The Slow Walkers"</li>
    <li>People willingly interrupting me during my time off</li>
    <li>Talking to me while I am trying to listen to music</li>
    <li>Being overwhelmed by work and assignments</li>
    <li>Spam texting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following list of the objects that I will talk about are in reference to my apartment at school and not at home (that's a whole different type of beast). These relaxation objects are just a few things I use to decompress after a long day, week, semester, and so on.</p>
  <h3>Coffee</h3>

  <p><strong>COFFEE, MY LOVE! IF YOU TOUCH MY COFFEE, <u><em>YOU WILL DIE!</em></u></strong> Haha, I'm just kidding... (I'm not kidding, watch your back).</p>
  <p>Anyways, coffee is one of those things that I don't necessarily need to destress but I do like to have. Like most people, coffee wakes me up and helps me get through the day but that's not the only reason why I love it so much. Coffee has many tastes and looks; it can be aesthetically pleasing or just an average cup of joe. You can add foam art, different flavored syrups, milks, and even type of beans! No two cups of coffee are the same, however, the thought of coffee and just having it in my hand after an early morning wake up makes the day worthwhile.</p>
  
  <h3>Music</h3>

  <p>Okay, I lied... music is actually my true love and has been since I was a child. Music is one of those things that manages to connect you with other people regardless of location or walks of life. For me, music has always been a constant means of relaxing myself especially when a song just fits the situation you are going through so perfectly. Whether it is alternative rock, K-pop, or nostaglic songs from my childhood, music is always by my side when I need it most. Not to mention, it is also fun to belt out songs during karaoke with your friends when you get the opportunity to. Music is also a great addition to creating a relaxing environment when paired with the next item on the list...</p>
  <h3>Ambient Lighting</h3>
